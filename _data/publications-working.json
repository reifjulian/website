	"abstract": "We investigate the effect of teenage driving on mortality and risky behaviors in the United States using a regression discontinuity design. We estimate that total mortality rises by 5.84 deaths per 100,000 (15%) at the minimum legal driving age cutoff, driven by an increase in motor vehicle fatalities of 4.92 deaths per 100,000 (44%). We also find that poisoning deaths, which are caused primarily by drug overdoses, rise by 0.31 deaths per 100,000 (29%) at the cutoff and that this effect is concentrated among females. Our findings show that teenage driving contributes to sex differences in risky drug use behaviors.",

	"abstract": "We develop a stochastic life-cycle framework for valuing health and longevity improvements and apply it to data on mortality, quality of life, and medical spending for adults with different comorbidities. We estimate that the average value of a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) rises by $64,000 (22%) following a typical health shock. Among the healthy, prevention of serious health risks is worth up to 17% more per QALY than prevention of mild risks. In contrast, conventional practice assumes that QALYs are equal in value regardless of context. Our results help explain why people value health improvements more in bleaker health states and why they invest less in prevention than in treatment."
