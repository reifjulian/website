	"abstract": "We develop a stochastic life-cycle framework for valuing health and longevity improvements and apply it to data on mortality, quality of life, and medical spending for adults with different comorbidities. We find that sick adults are willing to pay over two times more per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) to reduce mortality risk than healthy adults, and that prevention of serious illness risk is worth more per QALY than prevention of mild illness risk. Our results provide a rational explanation for why people oppose a single threshold value for rationing care and why they invest less in prevention than in treatment."
